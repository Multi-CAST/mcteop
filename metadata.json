    "description": "**Teop** ([teop1238](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/teop1238)) is a Western Oceanic language spoken on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea. The texts, all traditional narratives, were recorded by Ulrike Mosel and Enoch Horai Magum over the course of a [language documentation project](http://dobes.mpi.nl/projects/teop/) (principal investigator: Ulrike Mosel) funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (grant no. II 77 973). Details on the project can be found online at [the DOBES webpage](http://dobes.mpi.nl/projects/teop/).\n\nA sketch grammar of Teop ([Mosel & Thiesen 2007](Source#cldf:mosel.thiesen2007)) and additional materials are also available there, and an online dictionary (*[A multifunctional Teop-English dictionary](https://dictionaria.clld.org/contributions/teop)*, [Mosel 2019](Source#cldf:mosel2019)) can be found [here](https://dictionaria.clld.org/contributions/teop). The texts were annotated for Multi-CAST by Ulrike Mosel and Stefan Schnell; referent indexing with RefIND was added in 2019 by Ulrike Mosel, Stefan Schnell, and Maria Vollmer.\n\nThe Multi-CAST Teop texts (version 2207) also constitute a part of the [Teop data set](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/languages/teop1238) in [DoReCo](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/), which has been time-aligned at the phone level.",
